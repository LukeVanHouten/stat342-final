    abstract = { A vaccine containing an RNA molecule encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was tested in a trial in which two injections were given 3 weeks apart. After the second injection, Covid-19 developed in 162 patients receiving placebo, with a median follow-up of 2 months, and in 8 patients receiving the vaccine. Side effects were mainly mild-to-moderate injection-site pain and swelling. }

  abstract = {The article develops Bayesian procedures for the beta-binomial model and, using a suitable reparameterization, establishes a conjugate-type property for a beta family of priors. The transformed parameters have interesting interpretations, especially in marketing applications, and are likely to be more stable. Analytical results are developed for the posterior and prediction quantities, although the numerical evaluation is not trivial. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of Bayesian estimators, particularly in small samples, even with uniform ("non-informed") priors. The real data on television viewing behavior are used to illustrate the prediction results.}
