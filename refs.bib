    abstract = { A vaccine containing an RNA molecule encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was tested in a trial in which two injections were given 3 weeks apart. After the second injection, Covid-19 developed in 162 patients receiving placebo, with a median follow-up of 2 months, and in 8 patients receiving the vaccine. Side effects were mainly mild-to-moderate injection-site pain and swelling. }

 abstract = {The beta-binomial distribution, which is generated by a simple mixture model, has been widely applied in the social, physical, and health sciences. Problems of estimation, inference, and prediction have been addressed in the past, but not in a Bayesian framework. This article develops Bayesian procedures for the beta-binomial model and, using a suitable reparameterization, establishes a conjugate-type property for a beta family of priors. The transformed parameters have interesting interpretations, especially in marketing applications, and are likely to be more stable. More specifically, one of these parameters is the market share and the other is a measure of the heterogeneity of the customer population. Analytical results are developed for the posterior and prediction quantities, although the numerical evaluation is not trivial. Since the posterior moments are more easily calculated, we also propose the use of posterior approximation using the Pearson system. A particular case (when there are two trials), which occurs in taste testing, brand choice, media exposure, and some epidemiological applications, is analyzed in detail. Simulated and real data are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the calculations. The simulation results effectively demonstrate the superiority of Bayesian estimators, particularly in small samples, even with uniform ("non-informed") priors. Naturally, "informed" priors can give even better results. The real data on television viewing behavior are used to illustrate the prediction results. In our analysis, several problems with the maximum likelihood estimators are encountered. The superior properties and performance of the Bayesian estimators and the excellent approximation results are strong indications that our results will be potentially of high value in small sample applications of the beta-binomial and in cases in which significant prior information exists.},
