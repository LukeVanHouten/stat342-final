    abstract = { A vaccine containing an RNA molecule encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was tested in a trial in which two injections were given 3 weeks apart. After the second injection, Covid-19 developed in 162 patients receiving placebo, with a median follow-up of 2 months, and in 8 patients receiving the vaccine. Side effects were mainly mild-to-moderate injection-site pain and swelling. }

  abstract = {The article develops Bayesian procedures for the beta-binomial model and, using a suitable reparameterization, establishes a conjugate-type property for a beta family of priors. The transformed parameters have interesting interpretations, especially in marketing applications, and are likely to be more stable. Analytical results are developed for the posterior and prediction quantities, although the numerical evaluation is not trivial. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of Bayesian estimators, particularly in small samples, even with uniform ("non-informed") priors. The real data on television viewing behavior are used to illustrate the prediction results.}

  abstract = {An elementary sketch of some issues in statistical inference and in particular of the central role of likelihood is given. This is followed by brief outlines of what George Barnard considered were the four great systems of statistical inferences. These can be thought of in terms of the four combinations of two factors at two levels. The first is fundamental purpose (decision or inference) and the second probability argument (direct or inverse). Of these four systems the 'fully Bayesian' approach of decision-making using inverse probability particularly associated with the Ramsay, De Finetti, Savage and Lindley has some claims to be the most impressive. It is claimed, however, and illustrated by example, that this approach seems to be impossible to follow. It is speculated that there may be some advantage to the practicing statistician to follow George Barnard's advice of being familiar with all four systems.}
