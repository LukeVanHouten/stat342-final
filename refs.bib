    abstract = { A vaccine containing an RNA molecule encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was tested in a trial in which two injections were given 3 weeks apart. After the second injection, Covid-19 developed in 162 patients receiving placebo, with a median follow-up of 2 months, and in 8 patients receiving the vaccine. Side effects were mainly mild-to-moderate injection-site pain and swelling. }
